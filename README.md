OldSimfpl
=========

This was my first serious attempt at implementing a programming
language (and it shows!). As it is, there are a lot of bugs and it
couldn't be considered complete. I have no plans to work on this
project in the future -- there are quite a few features of the
language that I dislike, and I made some poor implementation decisions
early on -- but I've put it on GitHub for reference.

The language is called OldSimfpl in reference to the fact that about a
year after creating it, I started creating another language that's
also called Simfpl.
